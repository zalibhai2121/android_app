## Notes

I struggled a little building this app because it was my first android application. However, there are some similarities that android and x-code share so I was able to over come the problem.
Furthermore, while building this app there were a couple of implementation issues or the software side, but the directories had to be updated. Further than that the project was able to finish successfully.
